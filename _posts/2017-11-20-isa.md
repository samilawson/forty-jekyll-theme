When Marx writes that “Religion is the sigh of the oppressed creature, the heart of a heartless world, and the soul of soulless conditions. It is the opium of the people.” he means in part that religion has become merely something that people go to when they are in need and seek satisfaction (and complacency) with the conditions of life. They use it to rationalize the oppression of others, thereby affirming their inaction. They also use it to exclude and marginalize others through judgment and intolerance. They come to church to get their weekly fill of “God” and go home just the same as they were before. This horrid situation couldn’t be any better for the ruling ideology. By providing a framework to rationalize oppression, giving people a false hope of satisfaction, and making people complacent to the atrocities around them, religion quite literally turns churchgoers into a mindless base of loyal citizens. 
Peter Rollins similarly writes on the condition of the church in his book The Idolatry of God. He writes:
“the church then takes its place beside every other industry that is in the business of selling satisfaction… but instead of offering a freedom from this kind of thinking, the church has simply joined the party and placed its own product into the machine. Their god-product takes its place alongside all the other things vying for our attention with their promises to fill the gap in our lives and render our existence meaningful.” (22-23).
There are a couple of key takeaways from this that are quite startling. The first is that religion (the church) has been transformed into simply another industry (albeit with arguably more reaching impacts). This church-industry, then, becomes yet another avenue for the (fruitless) fulfillment of desires and loses its true meaning. The second takeaway here is that the church-industry attempts to “render our existence as meaningful…”, that is, it tries to give us a sense of purpose amidst the cyclical, repetitive reproduction of the conditions of production This purpose often seeks to shield us from the grim realities we live in because as churchgoers we are “set apart” from the others. This is what allows for the perpetuation of intolerance by churchgoers, this false sense of religious and moral superiority. Furthermore, this mindset allows for the justification of the oppression of the poor, minorities, LGBT people, and other groups because they aren’t part of the churchgoing “elect”.
Rollins continues later with a commentary on the things we learn as we grow and how they impact us: 
“not only are we given personal stories when we are infants (you are good, strong, brave, etc.), we are given larger political, cultural, and religious stories (you are Christian, Buddhist, capitalist, Marxist, etc.)… Such cultural, political, and religious narratives give us a sense of place and purpose. They tell who we are, why we are here, and what the meaning of our lives is.” (61). 
Rollins hits the nail on the head here,. These narratives not only give us a sense of place and purpose, but also inform and define our social positions and relations within society. By labeling people in such ways, starting from birth, it becomes easier to separate them into groups, thereby pitting groups against each other in a clearer manner and in effect forcing people to take sides, which in turn affects their social relations within the given field. Such labeling, for example, contributed and continues to contribute to things like racism. 
The final piece of Rollins I will throw at you echoes the overarching message of nonconformity. After commenting on his so-called Pauline cut, he concludes by saying:
“… the universalism that is captured in the idea of the Christian as the trash of the world invites us to identify with the one who is placed outside all systems. The one who identifies with Christ thus stands outside the very tribal systems that seek to define them. As a result we are being asked to give up the sense of mastery that our traditions offer and open up to the white-hot fires of unknowing and mystery.)” (188-199).
The message is quite clear: to identify with Christ is to reject the comfort and conformity of the church-industry. 
I challenge you to take a step back and examine how your religion operates in regards to identifying with Jesus. The Christian religion has been grafted into the Ideological State Apparatus and wielded in such a way to teach the exact opposite of what Jesus came to earth to tell us. A Christianity that embraces tolerance, opposes oppression, and is a true community of love and acceptance is a dangerous Christianity, dangerous to the ISA religion and dangerous to us because it requires us to abandon our comfort and conformity that perceivably benefits us. 
I was very delighted to see the issuance of the Boston Declaration as I was writing this and couldn’t help but share my thoughts on it because it echoes so much of what I have just written. The Declaration opens with:
“As followers of Jesus, the Jewish prophet for justice whose life reminds us to, “Love your neighbor as yourself” (Mark 12:31) we hear the cries of women and men speaking out about sexual abuse at the hands of leaders in power and we are outraged. We are outraged by the current trends in Evangelicalism and other expressions of Christianity driven by white supremacy, often enacted through white privilege and the normalizing of oppression. Confessing racism as the United States’ original and ongoing sin, we commit ourselves to following Jesus on the road of costly discipleship to seek shalom justice for the least, the lost, and the left out. We declare that following Jesus today means fighting poverty, economic exploitation, racism, sexism, and all forms of oppression from the deepest wells of our faith.”
This powerful opening statement expresses exactly what identifying with Jesus is supposed to look like. Many church leaders have made disgusting remarks regarding the recent sexual abuse scandals that are rocking our government and society and by no means should these people be allowed to continue to pervert Christianity in such a way. The phrase “normalizing of oppression” most stuck out to me, because often I’ll hear people talking about a certain terrible event and the conversation will conclude with a sigh and “we live in a fallen world”, thus writing off the event and committing to inaction. This normalization is the exact opposite of what we as Christians are to be doing. This is clearly asserted a few sentences later: “Whenever one of God’s children is being oppressed, we will fight with them for liberation with the power of the Holy and Life-Giving Spirit.” 
The Declaration is not arrogant, however, in its denunciation of the ISA religion. It expresses that “We acknowledge the manifold and complicated ways we participate in these systems, even as we are often complicit in them. We confess that the Church, in a variety of forms, has too often failed to follow the way of Jesus and perform the good news.” Such humility, as it says, acknowledges that none are perfect in regards to their role as Christians but that this Declaration is an attempt to express such ways that we can hope to improve in. 
Several lines later, the Declaration affirms its commitment to make the church a loving and accepting community of love: “We affirm the beauty and humanity of all people in their manifold difference--race, ethnicity, gender, sexuality, and religion--as reflecting God’s image through lives of love and hope.” Enough said there, all are welcome in the church. 
The Declaration offers a lament about the brokenness of the world but doesn’t stop there as most do. A poignant call to action accompanies it, affirming our duty to combat evil and oppression as followers of Christ: 
“As followers of Jesus, it is vital that we take action when our government seeks to continuously harm life made in God’s image by cutting social safety-nets and forcing the poorest and most powerless among us to spiral into an abyss of desperation. Action on the part of the church is warranted at a time when women, people of color, and various ethnicities, individual religions, immigrants and distinct sexualities are targeted for slander and violence from the highest offices of government. We cannot sit idly by and allow the people and the earth to be accosted with series after series of unjust policies that allow the interest of corporate profits to expunge the future for coming generations of humans and other living species.”
This paragraph calls out the complacency of the church, exposes the comfort we take by sitting in church on Sunday and trying to ignore the evil around us, and calls us to do something about it. Not only that, but it also charges us to take action against the mechanisms of the state and the economy that seek to further this exploitation and oppression; in short, it attacks not only the superstructure but the base. 
Perhaps the most exciting part of the Declaration was its condemnation and rejection of the prevalent societal ideologies. Included in this section are empire building, military action and weapons building, the ideology upheld by the corporate ruling class, American exceptionalism, white normalcy, misogyny, practices harmful to the environment, extreme individualism (and the accumulation of wealth thereof), Islamophobia, homophobia, transphobia, and anti-immigrant rhetoric. Nearly every statement of condemnation begins with “We reject the false ideology of”, a clear statement of defiance against the harmful ideologies upheld by the ruling class. 
The last section of the Declaration is a call to action, beginning with “Today, we as Christian followers of the Jesus Way, call on the people of the United States who call themselves by the name of Jesus, to reject all political and social movements that do not lead to life.” We are called to reject the ruling ideology and embrace the dangerous Christianity that leads us closer to Christ. My hope for this Declaration is of course to spread, to be embraced by congregations and Christians across America (and the world), and to move us closer to a more loving community. The message is difficult to accept for many, who find comfort in their complacency and conformity, but ultimately offers the way in which we can “practice what we preach.”
